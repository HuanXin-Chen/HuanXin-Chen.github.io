This blog is a secondary development based on [Slashgear](https://github.com/Slashgear/personal-blog). Most of the functions and styles of its blog already meet my requirements.

I probably won't update the blog style anymore. In my spare time, I will add some new functions.

#### Plan Todoï¼š

- Optimize the rendering interface and appearance.
- Optimize the table of contents list.
- Design an album function (similar to Xiaohongshu posts).
- Introduce a resume function.
- Introduce a technical monthly report column.
- etc.
